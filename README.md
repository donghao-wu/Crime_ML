# Crime Data and Machine Learning

## Purpose of the Repo

Crime has been a widespread and serious issue in society since the establishment of laws. Researchers have extensively investigated the factors influencing crime rates. 
Studies have shown that higher levels of inequality, unemployment, and poverty are strongly associated with increased crime rates (de Nadai et al., 2020). Beyond socio-economic factors, 
research has also highlighted the impact of environmental conditions, such as temperature. McCord and Ratcliffe (2018) found that higher temperatures contribute to an increase in aggressive crimes. 
Additionally, studies suggest that higher rates of gun ownership are linked to increased violent crime (Bhattacharya, 2020). Given the multitude of potential factors influencing crime, 
this project will utilize data from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) and machine learning techniques to explore key determinants of total crime incidents.
